# 1. Background
Woola Woola is an existing small business entity founded by Jean Tan, a friend of mine. 
It is an accessorized earrings store, which currently has social media presence as its only channel of marketing, 
communication and business transaction. As a strategic planning for future expansion, 
Woola Woola requires an ecommerce website to showcase its business and products and to conduct its business transactions.
This version of the website is an improved version that was built previously for my Project 1. The link to the first version
of the website can be found [here](https://farhansam.github.io/woolawoola/)

Github was used for version control, whereas Heroku was used for deployment.
The deployed pages' functionality, usability, responsiveness and data management were tested 
against the development version and both were found to match.
